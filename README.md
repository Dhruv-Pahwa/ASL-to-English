🚀 Breaking Barriers: Real-Time ASL to Text Translation! 🌟

Introducing my latest innovation: a revolutionary system that translates American Sign Language (ASL) into text in real-time using cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning! 🎉✨

💡 **Experience the Demo:** Watch as our system seamlessly recognizes and converts ASL gestures like "Hello," "Help," "I love you," "No," "Thank you," and "Yes" into text with remarkable accuracy. 

🔍 Key Features:
- ⚡ Real-Time Detection: Tracks and recognizes ASL gestures instantly with OpenCV and a hand detection module.
- 🎯 High Accuracy: Achieves 70% to 100% accuracy across different ASL signs.
- 📈 FPS Calculation: Ensures smooth, real-time performance with frames per second (FPS) display.
- 📊 Visual Feedback: Clear visual cues with labeled rectangles around detected hands and gesture predictions.

🌟 Technical Highlights: 
- 🖐️ Hand Detection: Uses `cvzone.HandTrackingModule` for precise hand landmark detection.
- 🧠 Gesture Classification: A robust Keras model delivers precise ASL sign classification with `cvzone.ClassificationModule`.
- 🔍 Image Processing: Cropped hand images adjusted to a 300x300 canvas for consistent classification.
- 📚 Model Training: Superior gesture recognition trained with Google Teachable Machine.

I've developed my own code and trained the model with Google Teachable Machine instead of labelimg.
